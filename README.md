# LaserQueue
A queue system for [NuVu](https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/discover)'s laser cutter, with websockets.

[NuVu Studio](https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/discover) has a lasercutter, and *only* one of them. A lot of people want to use it, and managing it is a pain. This software aims to simplify that with a simple web-based frontend accessible locally and on a TV mounted in the wall.
