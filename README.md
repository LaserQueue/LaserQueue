# LaserQueue
A queue system for NuVu’s laser cutter, with websockets. [NuVu Studio](https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/discover) has a lasercutter, and *only* one of them. A lot of people want to use it, and managing it is a pain. This software aims to simplify that with a simple web-based frontend accessible locally and on a TV mounted in the wall. It is developed primarily by [@sdaitzman](https://github.com/sdaitzman) and [@yrsegal](https://github.com/yrsegal).

## Getting the software
Download the latest stable version from [github.com/yrsegal/LaserQueue/releases](https://github.com/yrsegal/LaserQueue/releases) and decompress it.

## Running the software

Get the latest version by `git clone`ing the repo or downloading a zip. If there's a new update, the program will prompt you on run.  

To start the server, run `start.sh` or `start.py`. You'll need Python 3.4.x or greater.

To change the admin login password, create a plaintext file `password` under backend. This will be hashed upon script run.

### Flags:

- `-h`, `--help`: Display a list of these flags. Does not start the backend.
- `-p`, `--port`: Set the port for the website to be hosted.
- `-l`, `--local`: Start the backend in local mode. You'll connect with localhost.
- `-q`, `--quiet`: Start without output. Only applies to start.sh. Equivalent to >/dev/null.
- `-b`, `--queue-backup`: Enable queue backups. The queue will load from the cache on start, and cache every 20 seconds.
- `-r`, `--regen-config`: Regenerate the config. This is the default option if no config.json file is found in WWW
- `-n`, `--regen-host`: Regenerate the host in the config. Does not affect any other config values. 
- `-s`, `--skip-install`: Does not install dependencies that are not met. Otherwise, you will be prompted unless you use `--install-all`.
- `-nu`, `--no-update`: Does not install or prompt for updates.
- `--backend`: No short option. Only runs the backend.
- `--frontend`: No short option. Only runs the frontend.
- `--init-only`: No short option. Runs neither the frontend nor the backend.
- `--install-all`: No short option. Installs all dependencies without prompting.
- `--install-update`: No short option. Installs updates without prompting.

## Dependencies

All dependencies should be met the first time you run the program. The program will detect your system and prompt to install them. However, you will definitely need Python at ≥ 3.4.x for WebSockets. If (for some reason) you would like to install these by hand, feel free:

Required to start:  
- [Python 3.4.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip (`#~ curl --silent --show-error --retry 5 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python3`)

Other dependencies (installed on runtime):  
- websockets (`#~ pip3 install websockets`)
- netifaces (`#~ pip3 install netifaces`)
- GitPython (`#~ pip3 install GitPython`)
